TODO list
==========
 
  * create a pal::PointSet::simplify() that reduce the # of points of a line or a polygon
    depending on scale and dpi 
        expected effect => reduce the comptational time when setting polygons candidates costs
        this method should replace a part of the pal::util::extractXYCoord

  * check the behaviour of P_FREE polygon candidates when label height is bigger than its width
    -> change angle choice in pal::Feature::setCandidatesForPolygon

  * write new method for minimal bounding box adjustment
    -> on segment of the box is coolinear with a convex hull geometry segment

  * Building jpal library should also create a ch.heigvd.jpal.jar (10/20/08)

  * Test JPal

  * Add support for various unit (meters, yards, degree?, etc)
